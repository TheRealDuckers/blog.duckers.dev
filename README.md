So, basically, this grabs issues and displays them as blog posts. no backend, no tokens, just pure posts. (although you can add tokens if you want)

to use:

<li>Fork and Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME in the script with your repo.
<li>Optionally set GITHUB_TOKEN in the file for higher rate limits.
<li>Start gh-pages on main branch, and make issues to blog! Full markdown is supported, btw.
<li>CHANGE THE GISCUS CREDS! Get yours from <a href="https://giscus.app">giscus.app</a>
